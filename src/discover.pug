            p.p We began with a simple question: How do we get more people to cook their own meals? 
            p.p Everyone knows nothing beats a home-cooked meal, but cooking takes time and ordering takeout is, arguably, more convenient. However, with the rising cost of delivery, more and more people are struggling to find a balance between delicious food and maintaining a budget. 
            p.p TasteBase was created to give people that balance. 
            p.p At TasteBase we provide people easy access to healthy and affordable recipes that anyone can make. We believe cooking is a skill everybody can learn and, with our simple recipes, master. We aim to encourage people to lead healthier, wealthier lives while proving you donâ€™t have to compromise on good taste to do so.
